            <h1>Cast</h1>
            <p>
              The cast are made up of the actors, singers, and dancers
              (often all rolled into one) who perform on stage (and in
              videos) for the show. The cast are charged with power! The
              power to make the audience laugh, cheer, and lose control
              of their bowels every night.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a member of cast requires a massive commitment, Life
              becomes an intense blur of rehearsals, promotions, and
              performing, with Directors poking you the whole way along
              (don't ask with what).
            </p>
            <p>
              BUT! Being in cast is also arguably the most rewarding and
              exciting thing that you will ever do with your life ever!
              Making hundreds of people laugh, getting to spend 3 months
              with a bunch of awesome people, making friends that will
              last a lifetime, and making a very special contribution to
              this crazy ol thing we call CSE Revue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sounds like something you want to do? The wonderful thing
              about revue is to be in cast NO EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED!
              You don't have to be the loudest or funniest person in
              the world either, we'll teach you all the wicked skills
              you'll need. All we need from you is your dedication,
              enthusiasm, and luurve.

            <h1>Tech</h1>
            <p>
              The Tech team construct the props and the sets for the show,
              from massive spinning fans, to doors and giant pieces of a
              monopoly set. During the show Techies operate lights and
              sound, run around like cockroaches setting the stage and
              play with the fog machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only skills necessary are a good appreciation of
              teamwork and enjoyment of hanging around with others.
              If you have any experience with lighting, sound, set
              construction and related skills you'd be a particularly
              welcome member of the team. Tech consumes about 8 hours
              a week for the six weeks before show, and up to every
              show night depending on your interest. But hey, paint
              doesn't dry very well in the dark, so they'll knock
              off at sun down and hit the pub.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tech is a great place to pick up some fantastic skills,
              working in the dark with a team of people, potentially
              making split-second decisions which directly effect the
              show each night. You'll learn some painting and
              construction alongside the in's and outs of theatre.
              Although you might not operate a light/sound/video
              console for your first show you'll have the opportunity
              to watch and assist others in this task.

              The band are the masters of sound and music. As a member
              you will be part of the atmosphere and intrigue surrounding
              dances and skits. The band is also given time to shine in
              the illustrious band number - a highlight of any revue.
              They also have a great time, with a reputation for partying
              harder and faster than any that have come before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Band puts in a dozen or so rehearsals and the four
              performance nights in session 2. Outside of that, the
              band is always looking for ways to avoid work, chill,
              and jam the night away. If you are an aspiring band
              member then you will need to bring your own instrument
              along with the best musical talent you can muster.

              The Videos team takes ideas and scripts that are too hard

              and uses professional equipment to make them come to life
              on the screen.

              elements of production as well as introducing you to
              the post production world of editing and effects, there's
              always something to learn and be a part of. If you're a
              budding cinematographer, 3D animator or if you've just
              seen far too many movies, we'd love to have you on board.
              Everyone, regardless of skill level, is welcome to join
              us in creating something that will get us and our audiences

              The scripts team pump the show full of goodness in the

              Scripts is a network and community, a giant mish mash
              of people and ideas from which amazing things always
              emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scripts is a great way to get mixed up in this crazy
              thing called revue in session 1, and to be involved
              right from the word go. It’s also a wonderful way to
              get to know the people in CSE revue before the show
              starts to gear up. If something you wrote/suggested
              ends up in show, you can tell/gloat to all your friends
              about it!

              begins, provide them with food and drink, give them a band
              to listen to and show them to their seats. FoH ensure the
              audience come away from an enjoyable experience all around.
              FoH members enjoy socialising, talking and making people
              happy. FoH also attracts people with an eye for detail -
              the decorators among you will be responsible for the theatre
              decorations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Front of House Team will also be involved in filling
              the showbags we give to our audience with goodies. This
              means finding cool free things to hand out...everyone

              You can also join other teams that don't operate during

              one team. And the big bonus? The chance to see the show

              Don't think you'll need cooking talents in any sense
              (but if you have them - awesome! you can teach us a thing
              or two).
              <br/>
              We guarantee a hilarious time experimenting with recipes,
              watching kitchens being reduced to ashes, and having
              a celebratory shindig when something edible happens
              to pop out of the stove!
              <br/>
              All we need is a few of your hours in the evening
              whenever you can spare them, whether you're going
              dice happy with the meat and vege, teaching/learning
              a new recipe, or if you think moral support's your
              strong suit.
              <br/>
              Hospitality's also one of the more casual teams in terms
              of time commitment, so help out on any nights that you'd
              like. But you should know, the more often you appear
              through the doors, carrying hot, mouth watering food,
              the more everyone involved in the show will love you.
              <br/>
              Don't think that we only cook during Show and Production Weeks!
              We also have social Cooking sessions, and the occassional
              Cooking class, but most of all, we also look after camp!
              But it's not as if you're there to cook for everyone, you'll
              be at camp not only for the social activities, but also as a
              team member that facilitates Revue campers cook everyones
              meals on a rotational basis.

            <h1>Fundraising</h1>
            <p>
            The fundraising team runs all our bake sales, barbecues and other
            on-campus services. Fundraising is a super important team as they
            contribute directly to allowing us to afford bigger, better and
            more fun elements of the show and the Revue life.
            <br/>
            No experience is assumed and anyone is welcome. If you have baking
            experience you will be particularly welcome to join, but none is
            necessary. Being part of this team will mean many fun experiences
            of baking, chilling at fundraisers, as well as interacting with
            cast members during show week as they promote the show. If you
            want to be part of a team that has a high impact on the show but
            is also really chill, fun and accepting, then Fundraising is
            for you!
